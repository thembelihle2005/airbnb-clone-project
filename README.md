<h1>AIRBNB-CLONE-PROJECT OVERVIEW</h1>

<body>This Project dives deep into full- stack development, focusing on backed systems, API development, Database design, and application security.

<h1>THE PROJECT GOALS AND TECH STACK</h1>

Develop team axpertise in collaborative team workflows using Github.

Enhance knowledge of backed architecture and database design best practices.

Apply advanced security techniques in API development.

Build skills in creating and managing CI/CD pipelines for streamlined deployment.


Improve capabilities in documenting and planning large-scale software projects.

Learn how to intergrate technnologies such as Django, MySQL, and GraphQL into a cohensive tech stack.

<h1>DATABASE DESIGN</h1>

User Accounts: Build a secure system for user sign-up, login, and profile handling.

Property Listings: Enable users to create, modify, and view property listings.

Reservation System: Design a feature that allows users to book properties and manage their reservations.

Payment Integration: Implement a payment gateway to process transactions and maintain payment records.

Feedback & Ratings: Provide functionality for users to submit property reviews and ratings.

Database Efficiency: Optimize database operations for fast and reliable data access and storage. <br> <h1> TEAM ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES </h1> <br>

Backend Developer: Builds API endpoints, database structures, and core business logic.

Database Administrator: Designs and optimizes databases for performance.

DevOps Engineer: Manages deployment, monitoring, and scaling of backend systems.

QA Engineer: Tests backend features to ensure quality and reliability.<br>
<h1> TECHNOLOGY STACK </h1> <br>


Django: High-level Python web framework for building RESTful APIs

Django REST Framework: Tools for managing RESTful APIs

PostgreSQL: Relational database for storing data

GraphQL: Enables flexible and efficient data querying

Celery: Handles asynchronous tasks (e.g., notifications, payments)

Redis: Used for caching and session management

Docker: Provides consistent development and deployment environments

CI/CD Pipelines: Automates testing and deployment of code changes <br> 
<h1> FEATURE BREAKDOWN</h1> <br>

User Authentication:
This feature allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles securely. It includes authentication mechanisms to protect user data and ensure secure access to the system.

Property Management:
Users can create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings. It enables hosts to manage property details and availability.

Booking System:
Facilitates users in making, modifying, and managing property bookings. It includes details such as check-in and check-out dates to coordinate reservations accurately.

Payment Processing:
Handles all transactions related to bookings, ensuring secure and seamless payment processing. It may include integration with third-party payment gateways for added reliability.

Review System:
Allows users to post, edit, and manage reviews for properties they have booked. This helps maintain transparency and trust within the platform.

Database Optimizations: <br>
Indexing: Implements indexes on key database fields to speed up search and retrieval of frequent queries.<br>
Caching: Uses caching strategies to store frequently accessed data, reducing database load and improving application performance.
